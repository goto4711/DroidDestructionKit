# Welcome to the DroidDestructionKit!

Welcome to the "Droid Destruction Kit", (DDK) a collection of tools in a virtual machine for the reverse-engineering and network traffic analysis of Android apps.
This was provoked by the [Our Data, Ourselves](https://big-social-data.net/) project, which can read about in our
[paper](https://bigsocialdata.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/blanke-big-humanities-2014.pdf) at the 2014 IEEE International Conference on Big Data, and
[also](http://kdd.isti.cnr.it/pap2017/papers/PAP_2017_paper_3.pdf) at the [1st International Workshop on Personal Analytics and Privacy](http://kdd.isti.cnr.it/pap2017/) at
[ECML PKDD 2017](http://ecmlpkdd2017.ijs.si/index.html). [Here I am](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjjniizB794) at [PyData London](https://london.pydata.org/).

Unlike more complete and polished tools like [Santoku](https://santoku-linux.com/) and
[Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/), the emphasis is on granting techicnal novices some insight and agency into what their devices are doing,
rather than malware analysis or exploit development. You might also try
[Android Applications Reversing 101](https://www.evilsocket.net/2017/04/27/Android-Applications-Reversing-101/) by [@evilsocket](https://twitter.com/evilsocket),
or [Penetration Testing](https://www.nostarch.com/pentesting) by [Georgia Weidman](https://twitter.com/georgiaweidman). The
[Android Hacker's Handbook](http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-111860864X.html) is also a good read.

You will need:
* Oracle VirtualBox installed on your computer
* The VirtualBox appliance .ova file that contains the tools
* A Google account (preferably one you don't use day-to-day)
* An Android device (for the latter stages)
* An unlocked and rooted Android device (for the very latter stages)

Unlocking and rooting Android devices can be tricky, and can cause damage if done incorrectly. How to do this
is beyond the scope of this document, however, the DDK does provide the required tools.
